Mouf package
------------

This package is part of Mouf (http://mouf-php.com), an effort to ensure good developing practices by providing a graphical dependency injection framework.

Basically, you will find in this package some **Renderers**. These are classes in charge of rendering other objects.
They usually rely on *template files*, that contain the HTML to be rendered.
Renderers can be *chained*, and the first renderer that knows how to render an object will be in charge of the rendering.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Your template or a custom template is not apply.

* Purge the cache with the red button in mouf.
* You use Ajax and you return html with echo (for example BCE).
	* By default an echo don't apply the template to make it
		* add the defaultRenderer (a class of Mouf\Html\Renderer\AutoChainRenderer) in your class
		* add your templateRenderer (a class of Mouf\Html\Renderer\FileBasedRenderer) in Bootstrap this is bootstrapRenderer
		* add the code before your call to the function toHTML: $this->defaultRenderer->setTemplateRenderer($this->templateRenderer);
